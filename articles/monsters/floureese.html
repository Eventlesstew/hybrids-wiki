        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Floureese is a really introverted, apathetic little fella, they don't seem to be motivated to do anything,
            but they can be cheered up through even little things such as glow worms, their favourite critters.
            However, their true colours shine if they feel a strong emotion, which surprisingly, is shown when their
            Bulb form is activated, which I thought could only be done through Monkdom's power. In that Bulb form,
            Floureese’s true colours shine and they’re almost ready for anything. If there isn't something to excite
            Floureese for a period of time though, the bulb form deactivates and they’re back to being the apathetic
            introvert they are.

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Finally came around to conducting an interesting experiment. Using machinery suited to mix the DNA of beings from across different dimensions,
            and some inspiration from the Wublins of the Core Universe, I shall create my own singing monsters, which shall be known as “The Hybrids”!

            ...yeah, not very original, but hey, it's an accurate depiction of what they are. If you're wondering by the way, DNA extraction from the monsters
            was either voluntary or done in a way that they wouldn't really know what happened. Oh and don't tell anyone but I may have "burrowed" some samples
            from some folks at Void Labs, that monster who was fired included.

            <li>Blu's secondary ability was originally going to be an Impact Shield that functioned much like the shield Crim has now.</li>
