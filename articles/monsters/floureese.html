        </div>

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Floureese is a really introverted, apathetic little fella, they don't seem to be motivated to do anything,
            but they can be cheered up through even little things such as glow worms, their favourite critters.
            However, their true colours shine if they feel a strong emotion, which surprisingly, is shown when their
            Bulb form is activated, which I thought could only be done through Monkdom's power. In that Bulb form,
            Floureese's true colours shine and they're almost ready for anything. If there isn't something to excite
            Floureese for a period of time though, the bulb form deactivates and they're back to being the apathetic
            introvert they are.

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Finally came around to conducting an interesting experiment. Using machinery suited to mix the DNA of beings from across different dimensions,
            and some inspiration from the Wublins of the Core Universe, I shall create my own singing monsters, which shall be known as “The Hybrids”!
        </p>
        <p>
            ...yeah, not very original, but hey, it's an accurate depiction of what they are. If you're wondering by the way, DNA extraction from the monsters
            was either voluntary or done in a way that they wouldn't really know what happened. Oh and don't tell anyone but I may have "burrowed" some samples
            from some folks at Void Labs, that monster who was fired included.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Floureese is bigender.</li>
            <li>Despite being introverted and apathetic, Floureese is quite easy to befriend, mainly due to their kindness towards others.</li>
            <li>Floureese likes roaming around in the dark. If they're exposed to light while not in his bulb form, they will usually be seen sleeping.</li>
            <li>
                Glow worms are something of a special interest to Floureese. He really likes seeing them go on about their daily lives and will
                even defend them from any potential dangers.
            </li>
            <li>
                In many ways, Floureese is an opposite to Reese. Their bulb form is inverted, Reese likes being with his friends while Floureese prefers
                lurking in the caves alone and Floureese sleeps in the daylight while Reese sleeps in the dark.
