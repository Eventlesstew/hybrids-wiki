        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            You thought plants only lived on the ground? Well, this one ain't and clouds are basically water so
            she's good hydration wise. (Good thing I made the Sanctuary big enough to fit some clouds in) Boomin'
            Anemone, also known as Boomy, is a floating flower who enjoys making art just as much as her sister,
            Floral Anemone (The coloured petals were a result of her messing around with Colour berries) and she
            also likes playing on her drum kit. There are also times where parts of Boomin' Anemone's petals
            condense into water droplets which is caught by the raincloud below her and makes the same sound
            Blowy's dew drops make. Fascinating!

        <p>
            This is the other half of the failed 3-monster Hybrid I madeâ€¦ Yeah that's it. Hopefully after I make the new machines, they will handle the instability in 3-monster hybrids.
