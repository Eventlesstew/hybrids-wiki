        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Trumporaka is the unique result of a Single Element monster mixed with a Quad Element monster, Trumporaka
            enjoys creating stuff out of clay and even adding gems on top of them, which I've started growing in the 
            Sanctuary's caves to make sure he feels welcome. He even built his own version of Clay Kiln with a few gems 
            added on top of it, which looks eerily similar to the Clay Kiln that stood before it was burned down... 
            Was this an uncanny coincidence, or does that DNA have something else in it?

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, I kinda screwed up here. In a brain fart I thought Gemraka was a quad, but I realized a little too late that 
            it was actually a single element. I should probably organize everything before I try to break some limits again.
