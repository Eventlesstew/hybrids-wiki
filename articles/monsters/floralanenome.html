        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Floral Anemone, also known as Florie (I know it's not really an Anemone, but it does use Green Anemone DNA, shut up) is more of a
            muddled combination of Green Anemones and Florella's species than the wonders I've created. While seemingly more reserved than Florella,
            Floral Anemone is still far from being a prim, proper, put-together princess, she enjoys going around the Sanctuary's forest and seeing
            it's wonders and using some colour berries I gave her to make some art. Silly gal even got some paint on herself, which she decided to
            leave on and even painted her tail to look like a bee.

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            My first attempt at an actual three-monster hybrid didn't go so well, the instability in the process violently destroyed the machine and the actual result was two 2-Monster Hybrids... Very cool.
