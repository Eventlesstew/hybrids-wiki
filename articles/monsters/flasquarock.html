        <p>
            Flasquarock is quite weird. The glass floats and moves together and it seems like the lava has properties similar to Flasque's lifeblood in them, keeping them from shattering. In terms of behavior, which is not as weird thankfully, Flasquarock prefers being alone, but he is okay with having some company, preferably people who are usually quiet and chill.

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            After the smooth sailing creation of Floureese and Glactigloop, I decided to up the ante by mixing in two Double Elemental Monsters whose elements arenâ€™t related to eachother. It took a bit longer, but the result was still successful, though it seems like the Ground element was discarded for some reason. I wonder how strong the machine really is.

        <h2>Reason for Scrapping</h2>
            <p>
                I scrapped Flasquarock because trying to update his design after Volcarock's redesign was not fun, plus I wasn't a fan of both Volcarock's 
                current design and how Flasquarock ended up. I'd rather start fresh with another hybrid than try to keep Flasquarock.
