        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Arpeggileaf seems to be two seperate beings, but they're really just one creature bound together thanks to whatever
            traits Arpeggidough has. 
        </p>

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Decided to try with a double element this time. While getting Arpeggidough's DNA went just fine, I really didn't want
            to mess with Woodoos after learning what they do, so instead of getting Logobreak's DNA, I decided to compromise by
            getting the DNA of a certain Croot who was reduced to a stump.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Arpeggileaf won't be updated to reflect Logobreak's design.</li>
