        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            A silly gal who enjoys the simple things in life, Boistonitta enjoys plucking the strings on her horns which makes different sounds depending on if she's using something else (Mainly the cloud pick) to pluck the strings or not. The crystals around Boistonitta's shell also help produce some percussion sounds which have some added reverb thanks to the slime. Boistonitta likes drawing things using the colour berries I originally gave to the Anenome Sisters, which is how Florie became besties with Boistonitta. Judging by how many of her childish drawings (no offense, hope she doesn't find this) are around the part of the cave with a little skylight, it seems like that's where she likes to go for shelter, so I wouldn't be surprised if she also befriended Glactigloop or Phansmazt. (Floureese doesn't really go out of the caves much, he's more of a dweller than the others.)

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Since the Triple Hybrid experiment has found success! I decided to try it with more complex monsters. I did another benchmark using the DNA of Axonitta, Boiyong and Crystalotl and after pushing the machine to its limit once again, I got a Triple Hybird that.s a Quad Element! Amazingâ€¦ Wait what if I just did two Quad Elementals?

        <h2>Reason For Scrapping</h2>
        <p>
            I scrapped Boistonitta since she was a Shardite Hybrid. The Shardites were originally a fanmade MSM class,
            but they were eventually rebooted to be a separate thing distant from FanMSM in general. I decided to scrap
            Boistonitta to respect their creator's wishes to seperate the Shardites from MSM.
