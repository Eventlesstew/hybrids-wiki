        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Tortromtando is a goofy turtle who takes pride in the silly things he does.
            He likes to eat rocks, with lettuce coming at a close second, the former mainly because he can then shoot it out
            of that volcano head to pummel things with; He's mastered the aim so you don't need to worry about getting hit
            accidentally. Another thing he mastered is sending signals, which caused problems when they went through the
            Sanctuary and onto my machinery, but that issue is taken care of now thanks to the use of signal-absorbent materials,
            plus I installed some signal based devices in the Sanctuary so he can still have fun sending signals to them.
            While the legs on Tortando's back don't have a use with movement thanks to the flippers allowing him to go right side up,
            they serve as reliable object holders so he can hold a plate full of lettuce and rocks. Ain't that something for this guy?

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Now that I know this machine is perfectly operational and able to create three double-monster hybrids, I
            shall put this machine to the test! The first test was combining two triple element monsters to create
            Tortromtando! The results were a worn out machine and apparently, some of the elements are not included.
            Looks like something related to the stability of these elements.
