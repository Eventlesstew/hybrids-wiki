        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            For the next test, I've decided to try going one monster further and tried to create a 3-Monster Hybridâ€¦ sort of.
            The combination of DNA required to do these kinds of hybrids is much more unstable than the basic
            2-Monster, so it's been a learning curve making sure my equipment can handle that kind of destabilisation.
            This one is more of a start than an actual 3 monster hybrid, since I took Trash Cymbal and bound each trash can's
            DNA to a different monster, those being Theremind and Trizap.
