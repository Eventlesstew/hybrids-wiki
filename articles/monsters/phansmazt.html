        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Phansmazt is a prince figure to the Hybrids in the Sanctuary. Even though he's shy, awkward and a bit of a feline,
            he knows his way through most situations and is always happy to offer a helping hand to anyone who needs it. 
            Phansmazt likes the caves because almost nobody usually explores them and he likes the peace and quietâ€¦
            Well, I said almost nobody, Floureese has found a home in the caves too, more specifically where the Glow Worms
            are and when they found Phansmazt playing Checkers against himself, that's when the two became best friends.
            They enjoy each other's company when they need alone time in the caves and even play Checkers with eachother.
            Adorable! Phansmazt also seems to be breaking through his inability to speak (Thanks for that Phantar Pseudo-DNA) 
            through using his orbs to produce a Choir sound, this takes a lot of effort to do and ends up tiring Phansmazt out, 
            but hey, it's something!

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            If there's anything good out of all this rebuilding, all of my equipment helped me to see the flaws from the old 
            iterations and make better, stronger machines that can handle the potential destabilisation that goes into creating 
            Hybrids. Regardless this time, I tried using elements that are all similar to each other since they tend to be more 
            stable. Spirit, Spirit and Plasma did the trick! (If you're wondering how I got Phantar's DNA, it's not really his.)

            EDIT: I realised just now that Phantar was actually a human... Guess I need to look more into how dead Mysticals work, haha.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Phansmazt is not trans. (He is biologically male.)</li>
            <li>Phansmazt is demisexual.</li>
            <li>Phansmazt does not have dejavu of Phantar's life since the DNA used to make Phantar was an artificial form built from Phantar's pseudo DNA.</li>
        </ul>
