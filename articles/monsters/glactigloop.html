        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
            Glactis and Cosmogloops are… really freaking weird, and I'm talking about their biology. Glactigloop has both of their weirdnesses and the
            result is an interesting creature who has the best of both! They're really freaking powerful as echolocation and having one eye open is a
            deadly mix, only strengthened further thanks to Glactigloop seemingly being able to see the future. They're also capable of shapeshifting
            their body when needed, which really helps when fitting through small passages, good thing I replaced the vent covers with ones that they
            can't slide their way through though. They're also not as evil as they seem at first glance, they're loyal to others and are rather protective
            of their friends in Hybrid Sanctuary too.

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>
            Creating Floureese was an easy success, which I figured was due to the Light and Bulb elements being very similar,
            so I tried picking two elements that were a bit more different from each other… I should've known from the sigils
            that mixing Galaxy with Void would be another simple success.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Like other Glactis, Glactigloop doesn't really have a gender. They later found themselves to be non-binary.</li>
            <li>Glactigloop and Floureese are best friends, mainly because Glactigloop was the second Hybrid after Flour and that they're both chill.</li>
